### Background
The need for this ROSE-AP came from the need to get jobs sent from ERP to a STAR robotic cells database. 
An operator could then choose which job to run on which STAR robotic cell. 

### Solution 
The coming from the ERP would be in a CSV format. Using a CSV reader the data from the file would be published
to the ORION Context Broker as entities. These entities (jobs) would be then pushed to Crate DB and stored in a table. 
Whenever an operator initiates a start on a STAR cell from an HMI would have a table that would pull the jobs from 
Crate DB. The operator would then select a job from the list and press START. This would get the data transferred from 
the Crate DB table into the PLC.

### Install 

## Periodically uploading csv data

- start docker-compose (everything is removed and orion is changed):
```
docker-compose up
```
- start the bash script which will POST/PATCH a single entity created from the csv file, but with hardcoded data types according to the used data.csv:
```
bash uploadcsv.sh
```
- monitor behavior in terminal while changing the values in your csv file

- createcsv.sh and updatecsv.sh are scripts called by uploadcsv.sh so they need to have executable permisions

- if you want to restart this script you need to shut down orion or comment the line which creates entities because POST can be done only of non existing entities

- creating (POST) and modifying (PATCH) of the entities are done for first 5 entries (columns) in the csv file. You can add more data (columns) by modifying createcsv.sh and updatecsv.sh. 

## Connection to QuantumLeap

- in terminal cd into cratedb folder and type (the first line is needed to increase the virtual memory):
```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
docker-compose -f docker-compose-quantumleap-cratedb.yml up
```
- create subscription (open this file and change the ip address to yours):
```
bash post_subscription_csv.sh
```
- open in the web browser a page: http://localhost:4200
- there should be a table and you can query the table (press the query button)
